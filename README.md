A simple 16 x 16 Etch-A-Sketch program made entirely using HTML, CSS and JavaScript only as part of the requirements for the completion of the Odin Project.
Features:
1) Pick any color you want to draw. I recommend choosing cyan.
2) Either hover or drag over the squares to sketch.

Featues to be added:
1) Multi color mode
2) Variable grid size.
